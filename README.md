## Week 1
Introduction to C++, relation between C and C++, variables, simple programs in C++
1) [Hello World](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-1/hello-world.cpp): 
2) [Odd or Even](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-1/odd-even.cpp): Input a number to check if it is odd or even
3) [Working with Variables](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-1/variables.cpp): Declaring, taking user input and calculations
4) [Factorial of a number](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-1/factorial-recursion.cpp): Find the factorial of a number by using recursion
5) [Largest Element in array](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-1/largest-element-in-array.cpp): Find the largest element in a given array
6) [Maximum Number](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-1/maximum-number.cpp): Find the maximum number among 3 numbers
7) [Number Swap](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-1/number-swap.cpp): Swap 2 numbers
8) [Reverse Number](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-1/reverse-a-number.cpp): Reverse a given number
9) [Vowel Consonant Checker](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-1/vowel-consonant.cpp): Check if a given character is a vowel or a consonant

## Week 2
1) [Absolute value of different types of numbers](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/Week-2/absolute-value.cpp): Find the absolute value of an integer, double and float value using function overloading
2) [Cube of number by reference](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/Week-2/cube-by-reference.cpp): Calculate cube of a given variable using inline function and return the result by reference
3) [Largest number using inline fn](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/Week-2/largest-num-inline.cpp): Find the largest of the three numbers using inline functions
4) [Powers by repeated multiplication](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/Week-2/power.cpp)
Raising a number ‘N’ to the power ‘P’ is the same as multiplying N by itself P times. 
  - Write a function called power() that takes N (double) and P (int) as input, and returns the result N*P as a double value. 
  - Use a default argument of 2 for P, so that if this argument is omitted, the number N will be squared. 
  - Overload power() function, to work with int, long, and float. 
  - Overload the power() function for char datatype also, which should print P times the given character N. 
  - Write the main() program to exercise these overloaded functions with all argument types.
5) [Area of shapes](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/Week-2/shapes.cpp): Find the areas of different shapes using function overloading
6) [Volume Of Cylinder](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/Week-2/volume-of-cilinder.cpp): Find volume of cylinder, include **default values** in the function
  - default values: 1 for radius of the base of the cylinder and 2 for height of the cylinder. 
  - Calculate and return the volume of the cylinder, by calling the function from the main()
    - with arguments
    - without arguments


## Week 3
1) [Types of Functions](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-3/passing-by.cpp): Try different types of functions based on pass by and return by
2) [Ball Class](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-3/ball-class.cpp): Create a class "Ball" and declare various parameters and functions of it
3) [Fruit Class](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-3/fruit-class.cpp): data members and member functions of fruits
4) [Machine Class](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-3/machine.cpp): Create machine objects with various data members and member functions
5) [Managing Shapes](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-3/managing-shapes.cpp): Create a class named Shape 
  - private data members: ShapeName(char array), NoOfDimensions(int), Side1(double),Side2(double), Side3(double) and Perimeter(double). 
  - Add the following member functions – 
    a) getNoOfDimenstions() that takes the number of unique sides as input and updates the NoOfDimensions data member, 
    b) computePerimeter() – computes the perimeter of the shape and updates the data member, 
    c) getName() – that takes the name of shape as input and updates the ShapeName and 
    d) printData() – that prints all the details of the invoking object. 
    
7) [Student Class](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-3/student-class.cpp): Create a class named 'Student' 
  - Name, RollNo and PhoneNo as private data members. 
  - Include member functions getData() and putData() to input and print all details of the objects, respectively. 
  - Add a member function checkName() that accepts a name as input, checks if the name matches with the object Name. 
  - If yes, it prints all the details of the object with putData() function. 
  - Else, it prints the message “Names do not match”.
 
 8) [Triangle Class](https://github.com/AhmedBaari/c-plus-plus/blob/main/week-3/triangle-with-class.cpp): Triangle class with various data members and member functions
