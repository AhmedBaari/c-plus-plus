/* 

Write a C++ program that defines a class `Rectangle` with private member variables `length` and `width`. The class should have a default constructor that sets both `length` and `width` to 0, and a parameterized constructor that takes two arguments to set `length` and `width`. 

The class should also have member functions `get_length()`, `get_width()`, `set_length()`, and `set_width()` to get and set the values of `length` and `width`. 

Finally, the class should have a member function `area()` that calculates and returns the area of the rectangle. 

You can prompt the user to enter the values for `length` and `width` in the `main()` function. 

You have 20 minutes to complete this task. Good luck! */
