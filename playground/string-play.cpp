/* Write a C++ program that takes a string as input and outputs the string with all vowels removed. For example, if the input string is "Hello, world!", the output should be "Hll, wrld!". You should use string methods and modifiers to achieve this, and your program should be able to handle input strings of any length.

You have 30 minutes to complete this task. Good luck! */
